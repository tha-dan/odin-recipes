      If you're looking for a homemade pizza crust recipe that's great for

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Yeast</li>
      <li>Sugar</li>
      <li>Bread flour</li>
      <li>Olive Oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><h4>Let the Dough Come to Room Temperature</h4>
		  <p>
			After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to
			rest on the counter for about 5 minutes. This will allow the gluten to
			relax, making the dough much easier to stretch and shape.

		<li><h4>Prepare Your Surface With Oil
		</h4>
		  <p>
			  You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough. However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough. Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of olive oil and maybe a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking, encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.

		</l1>
		<li><h4>Shape the Dough</h4>
		  <p>
			  You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter which method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce and toppings.
